# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to

#  /* SVG 이미지는 '픽셀 단위'로 이루어진 '비트맵 방식'의 PNG와 다르게 '벡터 이미지 방식'을 사용하고 있다. 
  # 장점은 크기를 자유롭게 조정하여도 이미지 깨짐이 발생하지 않는다는 것이다.휴대폰은 기종별로 다양한 해상도를 갖고 있으며, 
  #개발자들은 이에 대응할 수 있어야 한다.PNG 파일 하나를 이용해서 해상도별로 크기를 조정해가면서 사용할 경우 이미지 깨짐이 발생할 수 있고,
  # 그렇다고 PNG 파일을 해상도별로 나누어 사용하기에는 소모 비용이 너무 크다.
  # 이 때 사용할 수 있는 것이 바로 SVG 이미지이다.플러터에서는 SVG를 쉽게 사용할 수 있도록 제공하는 플러그인이 존재한다. */

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  fonts:
    - family: impact
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/fonts/impact.ttf
        - asset: lib/fonts/Inter.ttf

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - lib/images/img1.png
    - lib/images/img2.png
    - lib/images/img3.png
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
